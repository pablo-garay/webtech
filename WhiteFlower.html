        Pig and PigLatin

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
        Pig was initially developed at Yahoo! to allow people using Apache Hadoop&reg; to focus more on analyzing large data sets 
        and spend less time having to write mapper and reducer programs. Like actual pigs, who eat almost anything, the Pig 
        programming language is designed to handle any kind of data&mdash;hence the name!.
        <br><br>
        Pig is made up of two components: the first is the language itself, which is called PigLatin (yes, people naming various 
        Hadoop projects do tend to have a sense of humor associated with their naming conventions), and the second is a runtime 
        environment where PigLatin programs are executed. Think of the relationship between a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a 
        Java application. In this section, we'll just refer to the whole entity as Pig.
